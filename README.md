# ContosoPetsApplicationProjectPart1
This is the Contoso Pets Application Guided Project Part 1 that I wrote as part of freeCodeCamp's Foundational C# with Microsoft course. Only the first two menu selections have been implemented so far, but I didn't like the simplicity of each in the guided project tutorial so I improved them to include validation among other things.
